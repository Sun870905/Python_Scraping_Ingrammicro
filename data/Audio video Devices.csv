Startech,.com 3.5mm 4 Position to 2x 3 Position 3.5mm Headset Splitter Adapter,Audio/Video Devices,MUYHSFMM,0065030843836,15,2,"StarTech.com 3.5mm 4 Position to 2x 3 Position 3.5mm Headset Splitter Adapter - F/M - Connect a 4-position headset with audio and microphone input to your desktop or laptop computer - headset cable - 3.5mm headset adapter - headset splitter cable - mini jack splitter - 3.5mm splitter SET SPLITTER ADAPTER 3PIN F/M
Have you recently purchased a newer laptop or Ultrabook and now you can't figure out where to plug in your favorite headset?
Most new laptops and Ultrabooks come equipped with a single 3.5mm 4-position (4pin) audio port that supports both audio input and output. A great number of headsets on the market come equipped with two separate headphone and microphone connectors that are not compatible with this new configuration.
The MUYHSMFF headset adapter features two 3.5mm 3-position ports that provide a separate headphone and microphone connection that can be connected to the single audio port on your laptop. Alternatively, you can also connect a separate microphone and powered speakers if you prefer to use Skype or chat online without using a headset.
Headset Connectivity
Simply connect the headphone plug from your headset into the audio output port marked with the headphone symbol, and connect the microphone plug into the audio input port marked with the microphone symbol. Plug the adapter into audio port on your laptop and you're all set.
Microphone and Powered Speaker Connectivity
Want to work or game without using a headset?
You can also connect a microphone and powered speakers to your laptop using the adapter. Just plug in your microphone into the audio input port marked with the microphone symbol, and plug your powered speakers into the audio output port marked with the headphone symbol, and connect the adapter to the audio port on your laptop.
Keep in touch while you travel
Are you travelling for work or taking a trip?
The headset adapter features a compact and sturdy design that makes it the perfect solution for mobile applications.
Tuck the adapter in with your tablet or slip it inside another carrying case. It works great with tablets and smartphones that have a single audio port. Just connect the headphone and microphone plugs from your headset into the adapter, connect the adapter to your mobile device and start talking.
This high quality 3.5mm headset adapter is backed by StarTech.com's lifetime warranty.
Please note:
This adapter is not a headphone splitter or Y-cable. It cannot be used to split the audio output to two separate sets of headphones or speakers.
Some laptops and mobile devices will not work with all external microphones. This is typically caused by an impedance mismatch between the microphone and the device. This is due to hardware incompatibility and is not a limitation of the MUYHSMFF adapter.

1 x 4 HDMI Splitter Transmits 4K Audio/Video to 4 HDMI Displays at the Same Time
Ideal for displaying digital signage in classrooms, healthcare facilities, churches, offices, restaurants, bars and trade shows, this Ultra HD HDMI splitter is quick and easy to install. It connects to an HDMI source device, such as a computer, media server, cable box/DVR or Blu-ray player, and transmits an audio/video signal to four HDMI monitors, projectors or televisions simultaneously. You can daisy-chain up to three levels of splitters, which expands the total number of connected displays to 256.Note: The B118-004-UHD is an HDMI Splitter, it sends the same image to all connected displays. If you would like to extend an image over multiple displays you will need an MST hub, like the B156-002-HD-V2.
Supports Ultra High Definition Signals up to 39 ft.
Using standard 28 AWG HDMI cabling, the B118-004-UHD Ultra HD HDMI splitter distributes a 4K x 2K audio/video signal up to 39 feet. Place your HDMI source up to 16.4 feet from the splitter and the splitter up to 23 feet from an HDMI display for a maximum distance of 39.4 feet between source and display.

The B118-004-UHD 1 x 4 HDMI splitter maintains full 3D and video resolutions up to 3840 x 2160 at 30 Hz and 36-bit Deep Color (12 bits per channel). It also supports a wide range of audio formats, including DTS-HD, Dolby TrueHD, Dolby Digital Plus and LPCM 7.1-channel surround sound.
Also Works with DVI Sources and Displays
You can also use legacy DVI-D single-link sources and displays with the B118-004-UHD to avoid an expensive upgrade to HDMI equipment. Connect DVI-D components using HDMI to DVI adapters, such as Tripp Lite's P566-Series. You will be able to transmit video only, and resolutions will be limited to those supported by the adapter.
Ready to Use Right Out of the Package
The plug-and-play splitter comes ready to connect right out of the package and requires no additional software or drivers. Its durable metal housing is designed to last a long time and fit seamlessly into any home or office application.

Enjoy peace of mind knowing your digital photo frame comes with Aluratek's 1 year warranty.

True Digital LCD Panels for Clearer Pictures

What does it mean to use a true digital LCD panel in an Aluratek digital frame? It means that all of your pictures will be noticeably clearer and much crisper than others that have decided to use analog panels as cost-cutting measures. The advantage of utilizing digital panels over analog panels is very similar to the difference in watching HDTV (High Definition Television) instead of standard definition TV. It makes a big difference to watch in crisp clear HD as all the vibrant colors and intricate details will be noticeably better. Your photos will be beautifully displayed at 1024 x 600 resolution on the 10"" TFT true color LCD screen.

Slideshow Support

Aluratek's 10"" digital photo frame will allow you to set-up photo slideshows set to background music. Slideshows can be configured to play photos in various display and transition modes. Photos will be automatically resized to fit the LCD screen perfectly in a 16:9 aspect ratio.

Multimedia Experience

The digital frame supports various media formats. In addition to photos, ADMSF310F also plays videos and music through the frame's integrated stereo speakers. Simply connect a storage device such as a USB hard drive, USB flash drive or insert an SD card into the photo frame to access your media content. Transfer and store files quickly and easily from your personal computer to the frame's 4GB built-in memory with USB 2.0. For an even more complete media experience, Aluratek digital photo frames include a built-in clock and calendar.

Motion Sensor Activated

ADMSF310F comes equipped with a built-in motion sensor on the front of the frame. The frame will automatically turn on when movement is detected up to 10 feet away. The frame will resume slideshow or video play. The frame will automatically shut off if no motion is detected after the set time. Set the frame to auto turn off at times of 10 seconds, 30 seconds, 2 minutes or 10 minutes so you don't have to unplug your frame before going to sleep, leaving the office or worry about wasting energy.

This 2-port HDMI switch lets you share an HDMI 2.0 display or projector with twoHDMI 2.0 video sources. The switch features twoindependent video inputs that can each support 4K resolution at 60Hz, making it the perfect solution for connecting twovideo sources to a display that has a limited number ofHDMI 2.0 ports.
Astonishing picture quality with support for Ultra HD 4K at 60Hz
This HDMI switch lets you harness the High Dynamic Range (HDR) capability of your HDMI 2.0 video sources and deliver it to your UHD 4K60 display. Unlike many 4K switches that only support a 30Hz refresh rate, this switch works with HDMI 2.0 displays with output resolutions of up to 3840 x 2160p at 60Hz.
Don't be fooled by a clever spin on old technology. Many HDMI switches support 4K but will only work at a 30Hz refresh rate, or claim support for 60Hz butheavily compresstheir signal to a lower 4:2:0 chroma subsampling in order to work at inferior bitrates. This 4K 60Hz HDMI switch uses the latest components to offer full support for your HDMI 2.0 equipment, supporting true4Kresolution at 60Hz with 4:4:4 chroma subsampling. Support for HDMI 2.0 devices means this switch can transmit bandwidth up to 18Gbps, making it an ideal video solution for high-resolution computer tasks.
The HDCP 2.2 HDMIswitch is backward compatible with 4K 30Hz and 1080p displays, which ensures that it will work with lower resolution displays such as TVs or projectors around your site or in your digital signage application.
Hassle-free operation with automatic switching
This switch ensures effortless operation with automatic switching that detects and selects a newly connected device, perfect for automatically switching to a 4K media player such as a 4K UHD Blu-ray™ player as soon as it's switched on. In your classroom or office boardroom, the automatic switch makes it easy to share your projector between multiple sources, which encourages on-the-fly collaboration among colleagues.
The HDMI switch also supports manual operation, using the included IR remote controlor the built-in front panel toggle switch.
The VS221HD20is backed by a 2-year StarTech.com warranty and free lifetime technical support.

The HDCP 2.2 HDMIswitchlets you harness the High Dynamic Range (HDR) capability of your HDMI 2.0 video sources and deliver it to your UHD 4K60 display.

This 4K 60Hz HDMI switch uses the latest components to offer full support for your HDMI 2.0 equipment, supporting true4Kresolution at 60Hz with 4:4:4 chroma subsampling.Support for HDMI 2.0 devices means this switch can transmit bandwidth up to 18Gbps, making it ideal for high-resolution computer tasks.
The switch is backward compatible with 4K 30Hz and 1080p displays, which ensures that it will work with lower resolution displays such as TVs or projectors around your site or in a digital signage application.
Hassle-free Operation with automatic switching
This switch ensures effortless operation with automatic switching that detects and selects a newly connected device. It's perfect for automatically switching to a 4K media player such as a 4K UHD Blu-ray™ player as soon as it's switched on. In your classroom or office boardroom, the automatic switch makes it easy to share your projector between multiple sources, which encourages on-the-fly collaboration among colleagues.
The HDMI switch also supports manual operation, using the included IR remote controlor the built-in front-panel toggle switch.
The VS421HD20is backed by a 2-year StarTech.com warranty and free lifetime technical support.

Aluratek's Digital Photo Frames are a wonderful way to bring your treasured photos and memories to life with incredible image clarity in rich and vibrant colors all on the TFT true color LCD at 800 x 600 resolution at an ideal 4:3 aspect ratio. The functional and stylish frame makes a great addition to any room of your house or office environment. With 4GB of built-in storage, memory card reader and USB support, it is easy to transfer and store all your favorite photos, videos and music.
What separates Aluratek digital photo frames from other brands is picture quality, ease of use, and affordability. You will not find a better quality image or video than what an Aluratek digital frame can deliver thanks to the best quality ""true digital"" LCD panels that are available on the market for production. Combined with an easy-to-use interface, wide format support, auto on motion sensor and the simplicity of automatic playback, Aluratek digital photo frames are the best choice for storage and sharing of your precious memories with family, friends, and coworkers. Enjoy peace of mind knowing your digital photo frame comes with Aluratek's 1 year warranty.

True Digital LCD Panels for Clearer Pictures

What does it mean to use a true digital LCD panel in an Aluratek digital frame? It means that all of your pictures will be noticeably clearer and much crisper than others that have decided to use analog panels as cost-cutting measures. The advantage of utilizing digital panels over analog panels is very similar to the difference in watching HDTV (High Definition Television) instead of standard definition TV. It makes a big difference to watch in crisp clear HD as all the vibrant colors and intricate details will be noticeably better. Your photos will be beautifully displayed at 800 x 600 resolution on the 8"" TFT true color LCD screen.

Slideshow Support

Aluratek's 8"" digital photo frame will allow you to set-up photo slideshows set to background music. Slideshows can be configured to play photos in various display and transition modes. Photos will be automatically resized to fit the LCD screen perfectly in a 4:3 aspect ratio.

Multimedia Experience

The digital frame supports various media formats. In addition to photos, ADMSF108F also plays videos and music through the frame's integrated stereo speakers. Simply connect a storage device such as a USB hard drive, USB flash drive or insert an SD card into the photo frame to access your media content. Transfer and store files quickly and easily from your personal computer to the frame's 4GB built-in memory with USB 2.0. For an even more complete media experience, Aluratek digital photo frames include a built-in clock and calendar.

Motion Sensor Activated

ADMSF108F comes equipped with a built-in motion sensor on the front of the frame. The frame will automatically turn on when movement is detected up to 10 feet away. The frame will resume slideshow or video play. The frame will automatically shut off if no motion is detected after the set time. Set the frame to auto turn off at times of 10 seconds, 30 seconds, 2 minutes or 10 minutes so you don't have to unplug your frame before going to sleep, leaving the office or worry about wasting energy.

Startech,.com USB 3.0 Video Capture Device,Audio/Video Devices,USB3HDCAP,0065030855952,274,15,"StarTech.com USB 3.0 Video Capture Device - HDMI / DVI / VGA / Component HD Video Recorder - 1080p 60fps - Capture High-Definition HDMI, DVI, VGA, or Component video to your PC - Capable of capturing lossless raw video making it compatible with Microsoft DirectShow - Record lossless video at 60 FPS ensuring every frame of content is saved - Capture with USB 3.0 bandwidth, enabling you to capture 1080p video at 60fps - H.264 video encoding for wide compatibility - Stream live video feeds onl HDMI / DVI / VGA / CPNT 1080P60
This USB 3.0 external video capture device lets you record 1080p HD video and stereo audio to your computer system. With multiple video inputs including HDMI, DVI, VGA and component, the capture card can record original content from various sources such as computers, camcorders, security systems, POS terminals, and servers. With a framerate of 60 FPS (frames per second) and H.264 encoding, this is the perfect solution for capturing high-definition video for editing, compiling, and archiving.
Seamless picture quality at 60 FPS
Record lossless video at 60 FPS ensuring every frame of content is saved, unlike 30-frame-per-second capture devices that only catch half the action. 60 FPS exactly matches the output of most computer video cards, which is great for recording the output from your PC, server, or POS station when creating software training and tutorial videos.
H.264 encoding for wide device compatibility
The included software encodes in H.264, the most widely adopted video codec in the world, ensuring your video captures will be compatible with almost any device platform such as PC, Mac®, iOS® and Android™ with no editing or converting required. H.264 is also widely supported by most software titles including Adobe Premiere® and Windows Media® Encoder. Plus, the software not only lets you capture and export videos, but it also lets you take screenshots, schedule recordings and instantly stream your video source over the Internet using online services such as Twitch.
This USB capture card is capable of capturing lossless raw video making it compatible with Microsoft® DirectShow. With raw video capture you can record video using your preferred third party DirectShow software such as Open Broadcaster Software (OBS).
Flexible Input Solutions for Convenient Compatibility
With multiple A/V input options you can capture from a wide variety of sources including HDMI, DVI, VGA, and component. You can also use this capture card with A/V adapters to record other video sources such as SDI using our SDI to HDMI converter (SDI2HD). Support for a variety of A/V devices is ideal for archiving analog video footage into a digital database.
The device also includes easy-to-use software that's compatible with NTSC and PAL systems, making it a must for professional video archiving applications where source media can change from project to project.
The USB3HDCAP is backed by a StarTech.com 2-year warranty and free lifetime technical support.

Siig,USB-C to Multi-Video MST Hub with PD 3.0,Audio/Video Devices,CB-TC0G11-S1,0662774043968,79,18,"USB-C to Multi-Video MST Hub with 100W PD 3.0 - 4K@60Hz Ultra HD - Multi-port Hub, High Performance 21.6G Bandwidth
Transforms a single USB-C port into a multi-port hub with HDMI, DisplayPort, VGA video, and USB-C PD charging
Notes:
Important information:

Adding additional displays to your system is simple with MST Hubs; however, they are mostly dependent on and tied to your Graphics Card's capability to operate properly. Make sure your system requirements are met before purchasing an MST Hub. Below are some key requirements for our MST
Hubs. Please contact us if you're not sure before making your purchase.
1) Make sure your DisplayPort or Mini DisplayPort is DP v1.2 or later. This is the most important criteria. If you're unsure, check with the video card or system manufacturer.
2) Mac OS does not support MST function and will only mirror the displays.
3) Install the latest drivers for your video card. Go directly to the system/video card manufacturer or chipset owner, such as AMD, Nvidia or Intel, to find the latest driver. Driver update through Device Manager may not retrieve the latest driver available.
4) MST hubs cannot increase the number displays a video card supports. Regardless of the number of display connectors built into your video card, each video card has a limited number of displays it can support. From our experience at the current time, AMD and NVIDIA video cards support up to 4 displays, while Intel supports up to 3. If you're unsure, check with the video card or system manufacturer. Note: AMD RX560 / RX570 / Radeon 7200 Series video cards only support up to 2 displays
5) Refer to our bandwidth table to make sure additional displays can be accommodated. It's important to note that if you use a 4K monitor to display in 1080p, there's a possibility that the link still gets 4K bandwidth and reduces the overall bandwidth for the other displays.

Tripp Lite,"8-Port HDMI Splitter - HDMI 2.0, 4K x 2K@60 Hz, HDCP 2.2, EDID Management",Audio/Video Devices,B118-008E-UHD-2,0037332239907,198,1,"Tripp Lite 8-Port HDMI Splitter - HDMI 2.0, 4K x 2K@60 Hz, HDCP 2.2, EDID Management - HDMI InHDMI Out - Notebook, Blu-ray Disc Player, Satellite Receiver, Video Game Console, Cable Box, Media Server, TV, Projector, Monitor, PC, Camera, ... Compatible 4K X 2K HDCP 2.2 EDID MGMT
Splitter with EDID management transmits 4K x 2K video and audio from an HDMI source to eight HDMI displays at the same time.

HDMI Splitter Transmits 4K Video + Audio to 8 HDMI Displays at the Same Time
Recommended for home theaters or short-distance digital signage applications in classrooms, showrooms, offices, churches, restaurants, bars, hotels and trade shows, this Ultra High Definition (UHD) HDMI splitter is quick and easy to install. It connects to an HDMI source device, such as a computer or Blu-ray player, and transmits a 4K audio/video signal to eight HDMI monitors, projectors or televisions simultaneously. You can cascade up to three levels of splitters, which expands the total number of connected displays to 512.Note: The B118-008E-UHD-2 is an HDMI Splitter, it sends the same image to all connected displays. If you would like to extend an image over multiple displays you will need an MST hub, like the B156-002-HD-V2.

Supports UHD 4K x 2K Signals up to 15 ft. via HDMI Cabling
Using standard 28 AWG HDMI cable, the B118-008E-UHD-2 distributes a 4K x 2K audio/video signal (at 60 Hz) up to 15 feet (4 meters). Be sure the HDMI cables connecting the splitter to the source and displays are no longer than 15 feet. For best performance, we recommend using Tripp Lite's P569-Series Premium High-Speed HDMI cables.

Supports Up-To-Date Features and Formats
The B118-008E-UHD-2 supports a wide range of audio formats, including DTS-HD, Dolby TrueHD, Dolby Digital Plus and LPCM 7.1-channel surround sound. It also features lip sync pass-through, 36-bit Deep Color, xvYCC and x.vColor, while receiving and transmitting up to 18 Gbps of bandwidth with no data loss. To ensure compatibility with the latest hardware, this splitter is compliant with HDCP 2.2, 3D and HDMI 2.0 standards.

User-Adjustable EDID Settings Gives You Control over A/V Resolutions
EDID (Extended Display Identification Data) allows the source device to identify the capabilities of each connected display and transmit to the highest video and audio resolutions shared by all displays. The B118-008E-UHD-2's default EDID setting uses the lowest level of video format shared by the displays (for instance, if two monitors support 4K video and one supports 1080p, all three monitors will show 1080p). In the event you want to override the automatic detection setting and control the audio/video output yourself, you may do so by adjusting the built-in DIP switches.

Ready to Use Right Out of the Package
The plug-and-play B118-008E-UHD-2 requires no additional software or drivers. Connect your devices to the HDMI ports with user-supplied HDMI cables (such as Tripp Lite's P569-Series), and plug the included external power supply into an AC power source to get started. An amber LED indicates the unit is receiving power, and blue LEDs indicate connected HDMI inputs. Use the included hardware to install the unit on a desktop or mount it to a wall.

This video wall controller lets you connect your HDMI video source to multiple HDMI displays, with support for Ultra HD resolutions and 7.1 surround sound audio. You can use the controller as a video splitter to distribute the same HDMI signal to four displays or you can combine your video source across four displays to create a 2x2 video wall.
Not all 2x2 video wall matrix controllers are created equal. While some HDMI 1.4 video wall controllers can achieve 4K resolutions, they'll only work at a 30Hz refresh rate. This 4K 60Hz HDMI video wall processor offers full support for HDMI 2.0, including true 4K resolution at 60Hz.
The HDMI video wall splitter supports HDCP 2.2 and is backward compatible with 4K 30Hz and 1080p displays. This ensures that it will work with lower resolution displays such as TVs around your site or in your digital signage application.
For hassle-free setup, the 4K HDMI splitter offers easy plug-and-play installation. Simply connect your source and 4 displays and the 4k video wall splitter will automatically create a video wall at the appropriate resolution.
StarTech.com conducts thorough compatibility and performance testing on all our products to ensure we are meeting or exceeding industry standards and providing high-quality products to IT Professionals. Our local StarTech.com Technical Advisors have broad product expertise and work directly with our StarTech.com Engineers to provide support for our customers both pre and post-sales.

Tripp Lite,IR over Wireless Signal Extender Kit - Up to 656 ft. (200m),Audio/Video Devices,B164-101-WIR,0037332225832,69,6,"Tripp Lite IR over Wireless Signal Extender Kit - Up to 656 ft. (200m) - Box EXTENDER KIT UP TO 656FT
Features
Wireless IR Extender Recommended for Displaying Video in Conference Rooms and Bars
This complete wireless IR transmitter and receiver system is ideal for audio/video presentations in conference rooms, lecture halls, home theaters, restaurants, bars and other locations where the source and display devices need to be separated or hidden from view. The B164-101-WIR allows you to control the IR-enabled source device, such as a DVD player or cable box, while holding its remote up to 656 feet (200 meters) away from it.
IR Pass Through Allows Total Access and Control with No Latency
The included transmitter and receiver units accept all IR signal frequencies from 20 kHz to 60 kHz to ensure compatibility with your IR devices. Because the source and display do not have to be within each other's line of sight, you are free to store them in separate rooms or inside IDF closets and entertainment centers. Make sure the receiver's IR bulb is within sight of the source and the transmitter's IR bulb is in range of the source's remote. The extender uses a 915 MHz RF (radio frequency) band for wireless communication.
Plug-and-Play Operation for Quick Setup and Immediate Use
The wireless IR extender kit works right out of the box with no software or drivers required. Connect the included IR cables for remote control, and connect the included USB cables to power the transmitter and receiver units. ""Lock ID"" buttons on each unit exclusively pair the transmitter and receiver, preventing interference from other components. Blue LEDs indicate power, data transmission and connection status.

Startech,Video Extender Transmitter/Receiver,Audio/Video Devices,ST124HDBT,0065030864558,1122,6,"StarTech.com 3 Port HDBaseT Extender Kit with 3 Receivers - 1x3 HDMI over CAT5e/CAT6 Splitter - 1-to-3 HDBaseT Distribution System - Up to 4K - Distribute your HDMI source to three remote displays over standard CAT5e/CAT6/ CAT7 cable - HDMI splitter - 4K digital signage distribution - HDMI extender - HDBaseT extender - 1x3 HDMI extender - Mountable HDMI over CAT6 extender - HDBaseT splitter HDBASET CAT5 EXTENDER UP TO 4K
This 3-Port HDBaseT™ extender kit lets you extend an HDMI® source to three remote locations, using HDBaseT technology. The kit includes three remote receiver units, and the transmitter features a local HDMI output, which gives you the ability to keep a fourth HDMI display at your local video source.
A complete extender kit that includes transmitterand receivers
This all-in-one extender kit saves you the complications and compatibility issues that can happen if you're not using the correct receivers. It's perfect for use in corporate environments such as small or large offices, or in retail, hospitality, and educational establishments.
Astonishing 4K picture quality from an impressive distance
With the A/V industry adopting 4K as its new high-resolution standard, long-range video distribution can be difficult, especially considering the 4K distance limitations on standard HDMI cables. You'll be amazed at how this HDBase-T extender kit can deliveryour video signal to three different locations while maintaining 4K Ultra HD picture quality. You get four times the resolution of high-definition 1080p, even at 115 feet (35 m) away from your video source.
The extender is also backward compatible with 1080p at 230 feet (70 m), so you can comfortably use it to make any video source look great.
Professional installation
HDBaseT technology offers a single-cable installation, so you can integrate this solution seamlessly using your existing CAT5e or CAT6 infrastructure. Plus, each device included with the HDBaseT extender kit is mountable, so you can keep the equipment out of sight in an equipment rack, or on a wall. This helps to reduce clutter and ensure a professional installation that doesn't draw your viewers' attention away from the content on your display. It's perfect for customer-facing displays in bars or restaurants.
What is HDBaseT?
HDBaseT is a standardized, zero-latency video technology that's revolutionizing HDMI distribution. HDBaseT uses an advanced method of modulation that enables you to distribute uncompressed HDMI audio and video, along with additional signals, over a single Ethernet cable.
Offering greater versatility than traditional HDMI extenders, and longer distances than HDMI cables alone, HDBaseT is the clear choice for every integrator and system designer. It can do so much, with just a single cable.
The ST124HDBT is backed by a 2-year StarTech.com warranty and free lifetime technical support.

Tripp Lite,USB C to HDMI Over Cat6 Extender Kit Transmitter Receiver 4K PoC,Audio/Video Devices,B127-1A1-CH,0037332253941,401,5,"Tripp Lite USB C to HDMI Over Cat6 Extender Kit Transmitter Receiver 4K PoC - 2 x Network (RJ-45) - 2 x USB - 2 x HDMI - 125 ft Extended Range - Metal - Black KIT TRANSMITTER RECEIVER 4K POC
USB-C to HDMI Extender for Displaying Video in Boardrooms and Conference Rooms
This complete transmitter and receiver system is recommended for video presentations in conference rooms, schools, trade shows, meeting facilities, houses of worship, retail settings and digital signage applications where the source and display are farther apart than conventional A/V cables allow. The B127-1A1-CH extends 4K video and stereo audio signals from a USB-C source device to an HDMI display up to 125 feet away via user-supplied Cat6 Ethernet cabling.
Supports USB DisplayPort Alternate Mode for Converting Audio/Video Signals
By connecting a USB-C cable to a source device that supports DisplayPort Alt Mode, you can output 4K video and digital audio to an HDMI monitor, television or projector without installing special software drivers.
Transmits Crystal-Clear 4K HDMI Video with HDR and 4:4:4 Color
The B127-1A1-CH supports Ultra HD video resolutions up to 3840 x 2160 (4K x 2K) at 60 Hz with 8-channel LPCM, AC-3 and DTS digital audio. Built-in equalization automatically fine-tunes the image quality at the remote display with no time-consuming manual fiddling needed. It's compatible with HDMI 2.0 standards for carrying HDR signals, which provide a wide range of vibrant colors with richer contrast, brighter whites and deeper blacks. HDCP 2.2 compliance allows you to stream iTunes and Netflix content with no complications. This kit also supports 4:4:4 chroma subsampling for top-level PC gaming or using your HDTV as a PC monitor.
Built-In PoC Technology Provides Receiver Power to Avoid Bulky External Power Bricks
Power over Cable (PoC) technology powers the remote receiver over Cat6 cable. Green and orange LEDs on both the transmitter and receiver will light up to indicate the system is receiving power and a signal is being transmitted. PoC lets you avoid the hassle of a bulky power brick and gives you the freedom to place the receiver away from an AC outlet.
PD 3.0 Charging Port Charges the Source Device to Avoid Battery Drain and Signal Loss
The USB-C Power Delivery port provides power output up to 20V 3A (60W), which is sufficient wattage for charging and powering the connected source device, such as a MacBook Pro or Windows laptop. Connect the device's power supply or power adapter between the USB-C PD 3.0 port and an available AC outlet to prevent the source from running out of power prematurely.
Local HDMI Port Supports Multi-Resolution Technology
Connect a display to the transmitter's HDMI port to monitor the image being sent to the remote display. The port allows connection of displays of various resolutions without affecting the 4K @ 60 Hz transmission extended to the remote receiver.
Plug-and-Play Operation for Quick Setup and Immediate Use
The included transmitter and receiver units work right out of the box with no software required. Mounting hardware is included for installing the units on walls, poles or 19-inch racks. Connect the transmitter to the source with a USB Type-C cable (such as Tripp Lite's U420-Series) and the receiver to the display with an HDMI cable (Tripp Lite's P568- or P569-Series). Then, connect the two units using Cat6 Ethernet cable (Tripp Lite N202-Series cable).
TAA-Compliant for GSA Schedule Purchases
The B127-1A1-CH is compliant with the Federal Trade Agreements Act (TAA), which makes it eligible for GSA (General Services Administration) Schedule and other federal procurement contracts.

Tripp Lite,HDMI Splitter 2-Port 4K @ 60Hz Multi-Resolution Support HDR TAA,Audio/Video Devices,B118-002-HDR,0037332237972,113,19,"Tripp Lite HDMI Splitter 2-Port 4K @ 60Hz Multi-Resolution Support HDR TAA - 4096 x 2160 - 15 ft Maximum Operating Distance - HDMI In - HDMI Out - TAA Compliant MULTI-RESOLUTION SUPPORT HDR TAA
HDMI Splitter Transmits 4K Video + Audio to 2 HDMI Displays at the Same Time
Recommended for home theaters or short-distance digital signage applications in classrooms, offices, churches, restaurants, bars, hotels and trade shows, this Ultra High Definition (UHD) HDMI splitter is quick and easy to install. It connects to an HDMI source device, such as a computer or Blu-ray player, and transmits a 4K audio/video signal to two HDMI monitors, projectors or televisions simultaneously. You can cascade up to three levels of splitters, which expands the total number of connected displays to eight. Note: You can expand the total up to 64 by including multiple B118-004-HDR splitters (sold separately) in the three-level cascade. Note: The B118-002-HDR is an HDMI Splitter, it sends the same image to all connected displays. If you would like to extend an image over multiple displays you will need an MST hub, like the B156-002-HD-V2.
Supports UHD 4K x 2K Signals up to 15 ft. via HDMI Cabling
Using standard 28 AWG HDMI cable, the B118-002-HDR distributes a 4K x 2K audio/video signal (at 60 Hz) up to 15 feet (4 meters). Be sure the HDMI cables connecting the splitter to the source and displays are no longer than 15 feet. For best performance, we recommend using Tripp Lite's P569-Series Premium High-Speed HDMI cables.
Multi-Resolution Support Allows Mixing and Matching of Displays of Different Resolutions
Say you have a brand new 4K (at 60 Hz) HDTV in the living room, but want to also connect your Blu-ray player or satellite box to the older 1080p TV in the bedroom. The B118-002-HDR is backward compatible with 4K x 2K (at 30 Hz) and 1080p (at 60 Hz) resolutions via automatic DIP switching. This splitter allows each television to display video at its maximum resolution. Most other splitters default each television to the lowest common resolution (meaning you would only get a 1080p image on that new 4K TV).
Supports Up-To-Date Features and Formats
The B118-002-HDR supports a wide range of audio formats, including DTS-HD, Dolby TrueHD, Dolby Digital Plus and LPCM 7.1-channel surround sound. It also features lip sync pass-through, xvYCC and x.vColor, and video amplifier bandwidth of 600 MHz/6 Gbps per channel (18 Gbps total). To ensure compatibility with the latest hardware, this splitter is compliant with HDCP 2.2 and HDMI 2.0 standards for carrying HDR (high dynamic range) signals. It supports 4:4:4 chroma subsampling for top-level PC gaming or using your HDTV as a PC monitor, as well as 36-bit Deep Color (12 bits per channel).
Ready to Use Right Out of the Package
The plug-and-play B118-002-HDR requires no additional software or drivers. Connect your devices to the HDMI ports with user-supplied HDMI cables (such as Tripp Lite's P569-Series), and plug the included external power supply (with four international plug adapters to ensure use all over the world) into an AC power source to get started. A green LED indicates the unit is receiving power, and orange LEDs indicate connected HDMI inputs. Use the included hardware to install the unit on a desktop or mount it to a wall.
TAA-Compliant for GSA Schedule Purchases
The B118-002-HDR is compliant with the Federal Trade Agreements Act (TAA), which makes it eligible for GSA (General Services Administration) Schedule and other federal procurement contracts.

4XEM's 2-to-1 splitter cable is an ideal device to increase the number of RJ-45 network connections on an RJ-45 outlet. This allows for two ethernet signals to go through a single CAT5E wire.
A technical product, this splitter is designed to greatly increase your ethernet installations. On one end of the installation this splitter can connect two patch cables from a hub to a single patch panel. It is important to note that this product is not designed to connect one single ethernet connection to two separate computers/devices-you would need to use a hub connection for that.
Problem it Solves: Enhance your ethernet installation with 4XEM's 2-to-1 RJ-45 Splitter cable adapter.

The new iPod touch

Fun at full speed.
Your music, wherever you go.
Love music? You can keep more songs than ever on iPod touch, which now comes with up to 256GB of storage. Get an Apple Music subscription to stream 50 million songs and download your favorites. Or load iPod touch with songs you love from the iTunes Store.
More power to play with.
iPod touch gives you an amazing gaming experience, thanks to the A10 Fusion chip. The action is smoother. You see greater detail. And everything feels more realistic.
A10 Fusion chip
The A10 Fusion chip brings up to twice the performance and three times better graphics to the new iPod touch - while still delivering great battery life. It powers augmented reality games and apps. And it makes everything you do feel faster and more fluid.
4-inch Retina display
iPod touch gives you a beautiful canvas for your messages, photos, videos, and more. Everything is sharp, vivid, and lifelike. All on a device that's 6.1 mm thin and 3.1 ounces, so you can take it anywhere.
Apple Arcade
Apple Arcade is a gaming service that lets you play over 100 groundbreaking new games. All you can play, online or off, without ads or in-app purchases. It's like having an entire arcade with you. Coming this fall.
Augmented reality.
Fun that goes beyond the screen.
Now you can explore amazing, immersive augmented reality experiences on your iPod touch. You can hold the cosmos in your hand. Virtual monsters can invade your neighborhood park. And you and your friends can have robots battle it out right on your desk.
iOS 12 is the world's most advanced mobile operating system.
iOS brings iPod touch to life in incredibly personal and powerful ways. You have access to millions of apps and games from the App Store. It's easy to be creative and expressive when connecting with friends. And advanced technologies protect your privacy.
Messages

Group FaceTime
Now you can have a FaceTime video or audio call with up to 32 of your friends at once. The tile of the person speaking gets larger automatically, so you'll never lose track of the conversation. And you can start the party right from a group thread in Messages.
Screen Time
Apps help us do so many extraordinary things that we can sometimes lose track of how much we use them. Screen Time helps give you a better understanding of the time you and your kids spend using apps, visiting websites, and on your devices overall.
App Store
Apps can transform the way you do anything you're passionate about, whether that's creating, learning, playing games, or just getting more done. And the App Store is the best place to discover new apps that let you pursue your passions in ways you never thought possible.

The new iPod touch

Fun at full speed.
Your music, wherever you go.
Love music? You can keep more songs than ever on iPod touch, which now comes with up to 256GB of storage. Get an Apple Music subscription to stream 50 million songs and download your favorites. Or load iPod touch with songs you love from the iTunes Store.
More power to play with.
iPod touch gives you an amazing gaming experience, thanks to the A10 Fusion chip. The action is smoother. You see greater detail. And everything feels more realistic.
A10 Fusion chip
The A10 Fusion chip brings up to twice the performance and three times better graphics to the new iPod touch - while still delivering great battery life. It powers augmented reality games and apps. And it makes everything you do feel faster and more fluid.
4-inch Retina display
iPod touch gives you a beautiful canvas for your messages, photos, videos, and more. Everything is sharp, vivid, and lifelike. All on a device that's 6.1 mm thin and 3.1 ounces, so you can take it anywhere.
Apple Arcade
Apple Arcade is a gaming service that lets you play over 100 groundbreaking new games. All you can play, online or off, without ads or in-app purchases. It's like having an entire arcade with you. Coming this fall.
Augmented reality.
Fun that goes beyond the screen.
Now you can explore amazing, immersive augmented reality experiences on your iPod touch. You can hold the cosmos in your hand. Virtual monsters can invade your neighborhood park. And you and your friends can have robots battle it out right on your desk.
iOS 12 is the world's most advanced mobile operating system.
iOS brings iPod touch to life in incredibly personal and powerful ways. You have access to millions of apps and games from the App Store. It's easy to be creative and expressive when connecting with friends. And advanced technologies protect your privacy.
Messages
Send free messages over Wi-Fi to anyone on an iPod touch, iPhone, iPad, or Mac. And add some personality to them with animated text effects, stickers, and more. You can also share locations and links. Name your group chats. And mute or leave the conversation whenever you like.
Group FaceTime
Now you can have a FaceTime video or audio call with up to 32 of your friends at once. The tile of the person speaking gets larger automatically, so you'll never lose track of the conversation. And you can start the party right from a group thread in Messages.
Screen Time
Apps help us do so many extraordinary things that we can sometimes lose track of how much we use them. Screen Time helps give you a better understanding of the time you and your kids spend using apps, visiting websites, and on your devices overall.
App Store
Apps can transform the way you do anything you're passionate about, whether that's creating, learning, playing games, or just getting more done. And the App Store is the best place to discover new apps that let you pursue your passions in ways you never thought possible.

Olympus,DM-720 4GB Digital Voice Recorder,Audio/Video Devices,V414111SU000,0050332189560,145,11,"Olympus DM-720 4GB Digital Voice Recorder - 4 GBmicroSD Supported - MP3 - Headphone - 985 HourspeaceRecording Time - Portable WITH 3 MICS
The top of the class DM-720 includes high quality recording features packed into an efficient, smart metal body. It is equipped with an easy-to-use interface, extended editing operations and various playback functions. The DM-720 provides outstanding practicality and reliability to support your recording needs.
""TRESMIC"" Three-microphone system for superior sound
The DM-720 features a three microphone system that includes both directional and omnidirectional microphones to faithfully capture the depth and fullness of the sounds recorded. This Tresmic combination provides a wide frequency range for the most demanding professionals.
Using the latest technologies, zoom microphone unleashes the power of proximity in noisy environments or when recording from a distant position. The zoom microphone allows you to expand and contract the microphone range by adjusting the direction with the ""+"" and ""-"" buttons on the recorder.
Create high quality recordings using linear PCM format. While this feature may exceed everyday business needs, when selecting this bit rate and sampling frequency, users can readily make CDs of their own recordings.
The Intelligent Auto Mode function automatically adjusts the microphone sensitivity according to the input level. This function makes it easy for users by automatically adjusting the microphone sensitivity according to the volume of the speaker.
The low-cut filter is used to eliminate sound at frequencies lower than 300 Hz during the recording process. By cutting the lower frequency sounds during recording your audio is free of background noise and distortion during playback.
The Voice Playback function allows you to skip non-voice parts during playback, and only play the parts of the file where there is vocal content. Voice Playback saves time and improves efficiency during transcription.
The Voice Balancer function works during playback, the volume of recorded voices is adjusted to make dialogue easier to hear. When voices are at different volume levels due to the distance and physical relationship to the recorder, the Voice Balancer automatically makes smaller voices louder, and ensures that louder voices stay below a given level, providing playback where everyone is audible.
The noise cancellation function powerfully reduces unwanted ambient sounds such as air conditioner noise or projector fan noise to enable clear playback quality.
Transcription mode comes in handy when creating minutes from recordings. While transcribing, users frequently repeat play, and stop to check the text. In Transcription Mode, the recorder will automatically playback the 3 seconds before the stop, so you can check the contents before proceeding. On the other hand, fast forward is preset to 3.5x so you can skip the silence in your recording.
Speech shadowing is an effective technique to learn foreign language by repeating the subject right after hearing it. This mode helps you learn languages by having the audio playback, and then silently playback repeatedly, so you can easily practice speech.

Tripp Lite,2-Port HDMI Splitter,Audio/Video Devices,B118-002-HDR-V2,0037332241450,89,14,"Tripp Lite 2-Port HDMI Splitter - HDMI 2.0, 4K @ 60 Hz, 4:4:4, Multi-Resolution Support, HDR, HDCP 2.2, USB Powered, TAA - 4096 x 2160 - 15 ft Maximum Operating Distance - HDMI In - HDMI Out - USB - Nickel Plated - Metal - TAA Compliant HDMI 2.0 4:4:4 HDR USB POWERED TAA
HDMI Splitter Transmits 4K Video + Audio to 2 HDMI Displays at the Same Time
Recommended for home theaters or short-distance digital signage applications in classrooms, offices, churches, restaurants, bars, hotels and trade shows, this Ultra High Definition (UHD) HDMI splitter is quick and easy to install. It connects to an HDMI source device, such as a computer or Blu-ray player, and transmits a 4K audio/video signal to two HDMI monitors, projectors or televisions simultaneously. Note: The B118-002-HDR-V2 is an HDMI Splitter, it sends the same image to all connected displays. If you would like to extend an image over multiple displays you will need an MST hub, like the B156-002-HD-V2.
Supports UHD 4K x 2K Signals up to 15 ft. via HDMI Cabling
Using standard 28 AWG HDMI cable, the B118-002-HDR-V2 distributes a 4K x 2K audio/video signal (at 60 Hz) up to 15 feet (4 meters). Be sure the HDMI cables connecting the splitter to the source and displays are no longer than 15 feet. For best performance, we recommend using Tripp Lite's P569-Series Premium High-Speed HDMI cables.
Multi-Resolution Support Allows Mixing and Matching of Displays of Different Resolutions
Say you have a brand new 4K (at 60 Hz) HDTV in the living room, but want to also connect your Blu-ray player or satellite box to the older 1080p TV in the bedroom. The B118-002-HDR-V2 is backward compatible with 4K x 2K (at 30 Hz) and 1080p (at 60 Hz) resolutions via automatic DIP switching. This splitter allows each television to display video at its maximum resolution. Most other splitters default each television to the lowest common resolution (meaning you would only get a 1080p image on that new 4K TV).
Supports Up-To-Date Features and Formats
The B118-002-HDR-V2 supports a wide range of audio formats, including DTS-HD, Dolby TrueHD, Dolby Digital Plus and LPCM 7.1-channel surround sound. It also features lip sync pass-through, xvYCC and x.vColor, and video amplifier bandwidth of 18 Gbps. To ensure compatibility with the latest hardware, this splitter is compliant with HDCP 2.2 and HDMI 2.0 standards for carrying HDR (high dynamic range) signals. It supports 4:4:4 chroma subsampling for top-level PC gaming or using your HDTV as a PC monitor, as well as 36-bit Deep Color (12 bits per channel).
Ready to Use Right Out of the Package
The plug-and-play B118-002-HDR-V2 requires no additional software or drivers. A built-in HDMI cable connects to the source device. Connect your HDMI displays to the splitter with user-supplied HDMI cables (such as Tripp Lite's P569-Series), and plug the included USB Micro-B cable into a USB wall charger or USB port on the source to get started. A green LED indicates the unit is receiving power, and orange LEDs indicate connected HDMI inputs.
TAA-Compliant for GSA Schedule Purchases
The B118-002-HDR-V2 is compliant with the Federal Trade Agreements Act (TAA), which makes it eligible for GSA (General Services Administration) Schedule and other federal procurement contracts.

Tripp Lite,"2-Port HDMI Over Cat5 Cat6 Extender Kit Power Over Cable, 1080p @ 60Hz TAA",Audio/Video Devices,B126-2P2M-POC,0037332201133,285,8,"Tripp Lite 2-Port HDMI Over Cat5 Cat6 Extender Kit Power Over Cable, 1080p @ 60Hz TAA - Box Style transmitter, 2 Mini Receivers 2PORT POWER OVER CABLE 1080P
The B126-2P2M-POC 2-Port HDMI over Cat5/Cat6 Extender Kit includes a two-port transmitter and two low-profile receivers that work in tandem to extend an HDMI audio/video signal to two projectors, monitors or televisions. The kit is recommended for digital signs, trade shows, classrooms, churches, offices, retail settings and other applications where the source is located farther than conventional cables allow.

HDMI cable (see Tripp Lite's P568-Series) connects the audio/video source, such as a Blu-ray™ player, to the transmitter's HDMI port. Cat5e/6/6a cable connects the transmitter to the receivers' RJ45 ports (for best results, use 24 AWG solid-wire Cat6 cable, such as Tripp Lite's N202-Series). The receivers plug directly into the displays' HDMI input ports. Built-in PoC technology powers the receivers over Cat5e/6/6a cable, so no external power supply on the display side is needed.

The B126-2P2M-POC can extend a high-definition 1080p (at 60 Hz) signal up to 50 feet and a 1080i signal up to 100 feet. In addition to crystal-clear video, the B126-2P2M-POC delivers full, rich audio up to 7.1-channel surround sound (multi-channel or PCM) and supports 3D and HDCP standards. Easy to set up with no software or drivers to install. Transmitter mounts to a wall, rack or pole using the included hardware. Complies with the Federal Trade Agreements Act (TAA) for GSA Schedule purchases.

Tripp Lite,HDMI Splitter 4-Port 4K @ 60Hz Multi-Resolution Support HDR TAA,Audio/Video Devices,B118-004-HDR,0037332238023,147,20,"Tripp Lite HDMI Splitter 4-Port 4K @ 60Hz Multi-Resolution Support HDR TAA - 4096 x 2160 - 15 ft Maximum Operating Distance - HDMI In - HDMI Out - TAA Compliant MULTI-RESOLUTION SUPPORT HDR TAA
HDMI Splitter Transmits 4K Video + Audio to 4 HDMI Displays at the Same Time
Recommended for home theaters or short-distance digital signage applications in classrooms, offices, churches, restaurants, bars, hotels and trade shows, this Ultra High Definition (UHD) HDMI splitter is quick and easy to install. It connects to an HDMI source device, such as a computer or Blu-ray player, and transmits a 4K audio/video signal to four HDMI monitors, projectors or televisions simultaneously. You can cascade up to three levels of splitters, which expands the total number of connected displays to 64. Note: The B118-004-HDR is an HDMI Splitter, it sends the same image to all connected displays. If you would like to extend an image over multiple displays you will need an MST hub, like the B156-002-HD-V2.
Supports UHD 4K x 2K Signals up to 15 ft. via HDMI Cabling
Using standard 28 AWG HDMI cable, the B118-004-HDR distributes a 4K x 2K audio/video signal (at 60 Hz) up to 15 feet (4 meters). Be sure the HDMI cables connecting the splitter to the source and displays are no longer than 15 feet. For best performance, we recommend using Tripp Lite's P569-Series Premium High-Speed HDMI cables.
Multi-Resolution Support Allows Mixing and Matching of Displays of Different Resolutions
Say you have a brand new 4K (at 60 Hz) HDTV in the living room, but want to also connect your Blu-ray player or satellite box to the older 1080p TV in the bedroom. The B118-004-HDR is backward compatible with 4K x 2K (at 30 Hz) and 1080p (at 60 Hz) resolutions via automatic DIP switching. This splitter allows each television to display video at its maximum resolution. Most other splitters default each television to the lowest common resolution (meaning you would only get a 1080p image on that new 4K TV).
Supports Up-To-Date Features and Formats
The B118-004-HDR supports a wide range of audio formats, including DTS-HD, Dolby TrueHD, Dolby Digital Plus and LPCM 7.1-channel surround sound. It also features lip sync pass-through, xvYCC and x.vColor, and video amplifier bandwidth of 600 MHz/6 Gbps per channel (18 Gbps total). To ensure compatibility with the latest hardware, this splitter is compliant with HDCP 2.2 and HDMI 2.0 standards for carrying HDR (high dynamic range) signals. It supports 4:4:4 chroma subsampling for top-level PC gaming or using your HDTV as a PC monitor, as well as 36-bit Deep Color (12 bits per channel).
Ready to Use Right Out of the Package
The plug-and-play B118-004-HDR requires no additional software or drivers. Connect your devices to the HDMI ports with user-supplied HDMI cables (such as Tripp Lite's P569-Series), and plug the included external power supply (with four international plug adapters to ensure use all over the world) into an AC power source to get started. A green LED indicates the unit is receiving power, and orange LEDs indicate connected HDMI inputs. Use the included hardware to install the unit on a desktop or mount it to a wall.
TAA-Compliant for GSA Schedule Purchases
The B118-004-HDR is compliant with the Federal Trade Agreements Act (TAA), which makes it eligible for GSA (General Services Administration) Schedule and other federal procurement contracts.

You can use the buttons built into the front of the unit to switch between the connected sources displayed on the two monitors. The B118-2X4-4K-A also includes an IR remote that lets you not only choose between the connected video sources, but also mute the sound and power on/off the unit.

It's compatible with HDMI 2.0 standards for carrying HDR (high dynamic range) signals, which provides a wide range of vibrant colors with richer contrast, brighter whites and deeper blacks. HDCP 2.2 compliance allows you to stream iTunes and Netflix content with no complications. This switch also supports 4:4:4 chroma subsampling for top-level PC gaming or using your HDTV as a PC monitor.
Built-In Audio Extractor Lets You Control Sound, as Well as Picture
TOSLINK/coaxial and RCA right/left audio ports allow you to connect an amplifier, receiver or soundbar for optical, digital or analog sound. The B118-2X4-4K-A supports 7.1-channel LPCM, DTS-HD Master Audio and Dolby TrueHD.

Installation is simple. Connect the B140-004 transmitter to a DVI source using a Tripp Lite P561-Series DVI cable (not included). Connect a Tripp Lite B140-series receiver (not included) to each display using a Tripp Lite P561-Series DVI cable (not included). Finally, each remote receiver is connected to an RJ45 port on the B140-004 using a single Cat5e/6 cable.

For longer extension distances, use a B140-1A0 or B140-1A0-WP active receiver unit to extend a 1920 x 1080 @ 60Hz signal up to 150 ft., or a 1024 x 768 @ 60Hz signal up to 200 ft..

For shorter extension distances, use a B140-1P0 or B140-1P0-WP passive receiver unit to extend a 1920 x 1080 @ 60Hz signal up to 50 ft., or a 1024 x 768 @ 60Hz signal up to 100 ft..

Further expand the range and number of monitors by using a B140-110 repeater unit. Add up to four remote units (three repeaters and one active receiver) to each channel of the B140-004, for a total of 4 displays per channel. (An active receiver should be the last unit in a channel) A 1920 x 1080 @ 60Hz signal can be extended up to 125 ft. from each repeater to the next unit in the channel, or a 1024 x 768 @ 60Hz signal can be extended up to 175 ft..

Offering transmission of 18Gbps HDMI content up to 70m/230ft by pairing Class A HDBaseT with WyreStorm's powerful lossless compression algorithm, the MXV-0808-H2A-70 brings the familiar power of the WyreStorm H2-series to a compact 1U chassis. Unlike competing compression methods such as CSC, which permanently remove color data, WyreStorm's VLC uses a lossless compression technology to ensure signal integrity.
With 8 Class A HDBaseT zone outputs & 4 mirrored HDMI outputs-which can be paired with WyreStorm's hybrid HDMI cables or any extender-and CEC triggering for all 12 connected screens, the 6x6 MXV-70 enhances the offering for the modern home or commercial installation.

OVERVIEW

HDMI 2.0 MAXED OUT!
Bringing our lossless compression technology from the flagship H2XC matrix platform, the 8x8 MXV-70 can handle both current & future video content technologies up to 4K/60 4:4:4 and high framerate HDR. The highest possible bandwidth that currently exists according to the HDMI 2.0 specification is no longer limited to short range copper HDMI cables.
CLASS A PERFORMANCE
Aimed at larger footprint installations and in a significant step-up from the other MXV models in the range, the MXV-0808-H2A-70 doubles the transmission range and can transmit high-framerate HDR or 4:4:4/60 content up to 70m/230ft using superior Class A HDBaseT paired with the latest in compression technology.

DE-EMBEDDED AUDIO
With audio functionality to match its video capability, the 8x8 MXV-70 has the ability to extract audio signals from either source devices or from the output, following the zone. Having S/PDIF connectivity means having the flexibility to send multi-channel 5.1 audio to local AVR's or downmix to stereo using the EXP-CON-DAC-D.

MIRRORED HDMI OUTPUTS
In addition to the audio breakout ports, the 8x8 MXV-70 also features four HDMI mirrored output ports which can be paired with any of WyreStorm's HAOC hybrid optical HDMI cables for transmission up to 50m/164ft or any extender for transmission of HDBaseT or OM3 fiber.

Because the H2X platform packs such a big punch with its standalone version, it wouldn't be sensible to not offer a modular version. Much like the 2K 16x16 modular matrix, WyreStorm takes custom AV distribution and control to new heights with the H2XC platform.
The H2XC platform gives integrators the utmost in switching and flexibility; for large projects that demand the latest in 4K HDR technology, while giving the integrator the freedom to choose exactly what goes into its chassis, making a perfect fit for the install. Fully utilizing the matrix, not your wallet.

You will find PresenterWall's ability to read everyday files from your computer, such as Flash, Power- Point, JPEGs and QuickTime extremely helpful; there is no file conversion necessary. In addition to understanding a vast amount of file types, PresenterWall also is equipped to stream from DVDs or live cameras, creating a virtually limitless palette from which to create dynamic presentations. The thought process behind SmartAVI's software is that you shouldn't have to worry about remembering which files will and will not work with PresenterWall, what you can or cannot use for content or whether or not the system will allow you the creative freedom needed to accomplish your presentation goals. Ease of use, adaptability of the PresenterWall system and broad range of files that end users will likely use for content have been the main focus of SmartAVI in the development of this system. We understand that you want to hit the ground running with PresenterWall, not spend hours trying to decipher a dense manual or struggle with unfriendly software. At SmartAVI, we get it and understand that the key to your vision's success depends on the flexibility and overall simplicity of PresenterWall.
Whether you have four or 12 video screens to use with PresenterWall, set up is made easy with SmartAVI's pointand-click software. End users have the ability to set up each monitorindividually (such as resolution and color quality) and then can ""add"" them to the PresenterWall system. For greater flexibility and simplicity, you can also define your video wall configuration within the software, such as 2x2, 2x5, 4x3, 3x4, 6x2, etc. and with one click, set all of the monitors in the group at the same time. This enables the software to communicate with each monitor separately or as part of a larger grouping for stretched/tiled images and video.

Offering transmission of 18Gbps HDMI content up to 70m/230ft by pairing Class A HDBaseT with WyreStorm's powerful lossless compression algorithm, the MXV-0606-H2A-70 brings the familiar power of the WyreStorm H2-series to a compact 1U chassis. Unlike competing compression methods, such as CSC which permanently remove color data, WyreStorm's VLC uses lossless compression technology to ensure signal integrity.
With 6 Class A HDBaseT zone outputs and 4 mirrored HDMI outputs-which can be paired with WyreStorm's hybrid HDMI cables or any extender-and CEC triggering for all 10 connected screens, the 6x6 MXV-70 enhances the offering for the modern home or commercial installation.
OVERVIEW
HDMI 2.0 MAXED OUT!
Bringing our lossless compression technology from the flagship H2XC matrix platform, the 6x6 MXV-70 can handle both current & future video content technologies up to 4K/60 4:4:4 and high framerate HDR. The highest possible bandwidth that currently exists according to the HDMI 2.0 specification is no longer limited to short range copper HDMI cables.
CLASS A PERFORMANCE
Aimed at larger footprint installations and in a significant step-up from the other MXV models in the range, the MXV-0606-H2A-70 doubles the transmission range and can transmit high-framerate HDR or 4:4:4/60 content up to 70m/230ft using superior Class A HDBaseT paired with the latest in compression technology.
DE-EMBEDDED AUDIO
With audio functionality to match its video capability, the 6x6 MXV-70 has the ability to extract audio signals from either source devices or from the output, following the zone. Having S/PDIF connectivity means having the flexibility to send multi-channel 5.1 audio to local AVR's or downmix to stereo using the EXP-CON-DAC-D.
MIRRORED HDMI OUTPUTS
In addition to the audio breakout ports, the 6x6 MXV-70 also features four HDMI mirrored output ports which can be paired with any of WyreStorm's HAOC hybrid optical HDMI cables for transmission up to 50m/164ft or any extender for transmission of HDBaseT or OM3 fiber.

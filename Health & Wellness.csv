Cta Digital Inc.,Automatic Hand Sanitizer Dispenser,Health & Wellness,ADD-AUTOSP,656777018160.0,81.0,15.0,"CTA Digital Automatic Hand Sanitizer Dispenser - Automatic - Spill-free SANITIZER DISPENSER
Our Automatic Hand Sanitizer Dispenser provides a hands-free sanitizing station wherever you need one - on a wall, on a kiosk, or on-the-go. This versatile unit clamps easily to CTA's mobile floor stands and mounts directly into CTA's Paragon floor stands. It can also be mounted onto walls or other flat, hard surfaces with screws (included), silicone, or double-sided foam adhesive pads (adhesives not included).
This hand sanitizer can be powered in two ways. For permanent installations, use the side port DC plug. To go cordless, simply use four 5V batteries (not included).
Once in place, the sensor automatically detects a hand, then delivers a supply of sanitizer - all without buttons, levers, or the need to touch the dispenser. Refills are a snap. Use the included key to open the front shell.
Use either the included refillable bottle or replace with a new disposable bag. To prevent messy spills, add one of CTA's compatible soap catching drip trays to create a complete hand sanitizing solution.

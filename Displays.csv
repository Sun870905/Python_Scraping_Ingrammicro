All the essentials, and then some
Maximize your workspace: A thin profilei and improved cable management create a smaller footprint, lending itself to a clean, uncluttered desk.

Enhanced views: The Full HD resolution is ideal for everyday tasks, while ComfortView is ready for extended viewing periods. It reduces up to 60% of harmful blue light emissions.

Versatile connections: Our E Series monitors accommodate legacy and non-legacy systems with convenient connectivity options like VGA and DP ports. Your workspace will be completely customized to your needs.

Adapts to your needs: Make your workspace your own with VESA-compatible mounts and stands.
Improved Dell Display Manager
Productive at every level: Dell Display Manager's (DDM) Easy Arrange feature lets you quickly tile and view your applications side by side across one or more connected screens for multitasking efficiency. And with the improved DDM, you'll get even more preset layouts.

Seamless transitions: The auto-restore feature remembers where you left off, so applications will go back to where you left them, even after you've unplugged.

The key to convenience: Shortcut keys can save you even more time, letting you easily configure your display management settings so you can get to work faster.

More ways to manage: Asset management reports allow IT managers to quickly capture and track monitor information as well as configure multiple monitors at once through a single setup.
Eco-friendly inside and out
Guaranteed green: Compliant with the latest Energy Star® standards, the E Series monitors meet stringent energy efficiency requirements while in sleep, on and off modes. They're also EPEAT® registered and TCO-certified.

Energy reducing: Save energy with PowerNap, a feature that dims or puts the monitor to sleep when not in use.

Clean disposal: Composting or recycling the packaging is easy since it's made with at least 25% of recycled cardboard.

ASUS VG278QR Gaming Monitor - 27inch, Full HD, 0.5ms, 165Hz, FreeSync/Adaptive Sync
Designed for intense, fast-paced games, ASUS VG278QR is a 27"" Full HD gaming display with an ultra-fast 0.5ms response time and blazing 165hz refresh rate to give you super-smooth gameplay. VG278QR features Adaptive-Sync (FreeSync™) technology to eliminate screen tearing and choppy frame rate.

Gamer-centric features like ASUS GamePlus enhances your
in-game experience, while GameVisual provides various pre-set display modes to optimise visuals for different types of games.
Speed, speed, and more speed
Lightning-fast 0.5ms response time with ASUS Extreme Low Motion Blur
ASUS VG278QR is the fastest in its class, boasting a 0.5ms response time to eliminate smearing and motion blur. This lets you react instantly to what you see onscreen, especially in fast paced games - allowing you to take corners like a pro race car driver, or get that headshot like a seasoned pro.
There's also the ASUS Extreme Low Motion Blur (ELMB) Technology to make objects in motion look even sharper, so gameplay is more fluid and responsive.
Incredible 165hz refresh rate
With an astonishing 165hz refresh rate, fast-moving visuals pose no problem for VG278QR. There's no frustrating lag, so you get the upper hand in first person shooters, racers, real-time strategy and sports titles.
Adaptive-Sync technology for smooth gameplay
VG278QR features Adaptive-Sync (FreeSync™) technology - it eliminates screen tearing and choppy frame rates to give you seamless visuals and smooth gameplay.
GameFast Input Technology - because milliseconds count
Input lag on an LCD monitor is typically much lower than a TV, and ASUS VG278QR features GameFast Input Technology to further minimise input lag. This technology provides much faster motion delivery so you'll always be up to speed with in-game action at the precise timing you need to respond as quickly as is needed.
Gamer-centric features
ASUS-exclusive GamePlus technology
ASUS VG278QR features the ASUS-exclusive GamePlus hotkey to give you in-game enhancements that help you get more out of your game.
This function is co-developed with pro-gamer input, allowing them to practice and improve their gaming skills.
A crosshair overlay provides four different crosshair options, so you can select the one that best suits the shooter you're currently playing.

NEXT-GEN ADAPTIVE-SYNC
TUF Gaming VG32V is a 32-inch, WQHD (2560x1440), curved HDR display with an ultrafast 144Hz refresh rate designed for professional gamers and those seeking immersive gameplay. Those are some serious specs, but not even the most exciting thing the VG32V has in store.
For the first time in any gaming monitor, Motion Blur Reduction and Adaptive-sync can be enabled at the same time. This new technology is called ASUS Extreme Low Motion Blur Sync (ELMB SYNC). ELMB SYNC works with FreeSync and other types of Adaptive-sync, allowing gamers to enjoy sharp, high speed frames.
31.5"" WQHD curve
The 31.5-inch WQHD (2560 X 1440) panel of TUF Gaming VG32VQ delivers stunning visuals from all angles with an 1800R curvature that ensures every point is equidistant to your eyes. This contributes to greater viewing comfort - even during extended use -and lets you enjoy a wide viewing angle with less distortion and color shift when gaming and watching movies.
144Hz Refresh Rate
TUF Gaming VG32VQ has a super-fast 144Hz refresh rate, ensuring that even fast-paced games played at the highest visual settings look buttery smooth and completely lag-free. Get the upper hand in first-person-shooters, racing, real-time strategy and sports titles.
EXTREME LOW MOTION BLUR SYNC
With ELMB SYNC, you can enable ELMB (low-motion-blur technology) and FreeSync at the same time, eliminating ghosting and tearing for sharp visuals and high frame rates while gaming.
Multi HDR Mode
Now you can choose from multiple HDR modes to adjust monitor HDR performance based on the current viewing scenario
Shadow Boost
ASUS Shadow Boost technology clarifies dark areas of the game without overexposing brighter areas, improving overall viewing while also making it easier to spot enemies hidden in dark areas of the map.
Rich connectivity
Extensive connectivity options, including, DisplayPort 1.2, and HDMI (v2.0) port support a wide array of multimedia devices.

Open Frame 7"" USB Capacitive Touch Screen Monitor
The UM-760C-OF/UM-760CH-OF adds Capacitive touch to the 7"" line of open frame displays. The UM-760C-OF/UM-760CH-OF is a 7"" small capacitive open frame touchscreen monitor for applications that will be integrated into other equipment or enclosures. Same slick design features but now with the responsiveness of a 5 point multi-touch capacitive touchscreen all in a long-lasting molded metal product cycle-enclosure. Future generation panels can be phased-in without external changes. The screen can display in either landscape or portrait orientations. The UM-760C-OF/UM-760CH-OF open frame touchscreen monitor is designed to provide the most cost effective solutions for consumer, retail POS, and hospitality markets.
Available in Single Cable USB Video
Utilizing the same single cable USB display technology as our line of displays, the UM-760C-OF sends video, touch, and power over a single USB connection.
And now available with HDMI
Now optionally available with the ubiquitous HDMI input for video. Previously only available with the convenience of single cable USB video, the UM-760CH-OF from Mimo Monitors now offers HDMI to supplement where USB video is not supported or inconvenient. With the HID compliant touch screen plus HDMI video, the new UM-760CH-OF can be installed to almost any platform without drivers.
Uniquely, this new monitor line still reduces number of cables. While a typical HDMI touch display will require 3 separate cables, the new HDMI touch displays from Mimo Monitors only require 2 cables. This simplifies connection, and makes for a more attractive installation.

Open Frame 7"" USB Capacitive Touch Screen Monitor
The UM-760C-OF/UM-760CH-OF adds Capacitive touch to the 7"" line of open frame displays. The UM-760C-OF/UM-760CH-OF is a 7"" small capacitive open frame touchscreen monitor for applications that will be integrated into other equipment or enclosures. Same slick design features but now with the responsiveness of a 5 point multi-touch capacitive touchscreen all in a long-lasting molded metal product cycle-enclosure. Future generation panels can be phased-in without external changes. The screen can display in either landscape or portrait orientations. The UM-760C-OF/UM-760CH-OF open frame touchscreen monitor is designed to provide the most cost effective solutions for consumer, retail POS, and hospitality markets.
Available in Single Cable USB Video
Utilizing the same single cable USB display technology as our line of displays, the UM-760C-OF sends video, touch, and power over a single USB connection.
And now available with HDMI
Now optionally available with the ubiquitous HDMI input for video. Previously only available with the convenience of single cable USB video, the UM-760CH-OF from Mimo Monitors now offers HDMI to supplement where USB video is not supported or inconvenient. With the HID compliant touch screen plus HDMI video, the new UM-760CH-OF can be installed to almost any platform without drivers.
Uniquely, this new monitor line still reduces number of cables. While a typical HDMI touch display will require 3 separate cables, the new HDMI touch displays from Mimo Monitors only require 2 cables. This simplifies connection, and makes for a more attractive installation.

Quadruple the Size of Your Work Space
Because various applications are used at work, a high resolution monitor with a large amount of work space is ideal for improving productivity. The EV3285 supports 4K resolution, displaying four times the amount of standard full HD monitors. With 4K you can display all applications on the one screen, without needing to switch windows or scroll through screens, allowing work to progress faster.
Fit 4K Resolution on Any Desk with this Fully Flat and Frameless Design
Conventional 4K monitors are large and bulky, making them difficult to install on small desks. The EV3285 solves this by adopting a fully flat and frameless design which keeps the monitor slim and lightweight. Compared to the previous model, the EV3285 has been reduced in volume by 17%, and the stand base has decreased by 12%. With these reductions, the EV3285 can comfortably fit on any desk.
Beautiful from Front to Back
One Cable ConnectionSingle Cable Connection with USB Type-C
When working on the go, a notebook PC is essential. But when work needs to be done in the office, connecting a notebook PC to an external monitor is beneficial. With USB Type-C, the EV3285 makes this new work style a breeze.
With a single USB Type-C cable you can transmit both video and audio signals, transfer data, and supply up to 60W of power to attached devices such as smartphones and notebooks. What's more, it has an internal power unit so no external AC adapter is required.
Without worrying about your notebook's battery level, you can simple plug it in and begin working immediately on a large external screen. Furthermore, a keyboard and mouse can be connected to the monitor and used instantly once the notebook is plugged in with USB Type-C.
60 W Power Supply for Use with High-End Notebooks
The USB Type-C terminal supplies up to 60 watts of power making it ideal for use with XPS, MacBook Pro, and other high-end notebooks.
Auto Brightness Control
To prevent eye fatigue, a brightness sensor called Auto EcoView detects the changes in the ambient brightness that occurs throughout the day and automatically adjusts the screen to the ideal brightness level.
Reduce Blue Light by 80%
In the visible light spectrum, blue light has wavelengths adjacent to ultraviolet light. Compared to the factory preset setting of 6500 K of typical LCD monitors, Paper Mode is closer to the spectral distribution with long reddish wavelengths so it reduces the amount of blue light, a cause of eye fatigue, and helps prevent eyestrain when reading documents. When used in conjunction with Auto EcoView dimming function, blue light can be reduced by as much as 80%.
Minimum Brightness of Approximately 1 cd/m2
In a dimly-lit work environment, a monitor with low brightness settings is more comfortable to use. With its LED backlight, the monitor is adjustable to approximately 1 cd/m² which is less than 1% of the maximum.
Versatile Stand
The stand features height adjustment, tilt, and swivel, while saving space and remaining stylish. Quickly and smoothly adjust your monitor to the perfect position.
Intelligent Software to Work Better
Auto Color Mode
Use the Auto Color Mode to assign a color mode to turn on when using specific applications such as those for writing documents, photo viewing, creating illustrations or watching movies. When an application is opened the screen will automatically switch to the assigned color mode, making manual switching unnecessary.

CURVED FOR YOUR VIEWING PLEASURE
Optix monitors use a curved display panel that has a curvature rate of R1500, which is the most comfortable and suitable for a wide range of applications from general computing to gaming. Curved panels also help with gameplay immersion, making you feel more connected to the entire experience.
144HZ REFRESH RATE + 1MS RESPONSE TIME
Optix monitors are equipped with a 144hz refresh rate + 1ms response time VA LED panel which has the most benefit in fast moving game genres such as first person shooters, fighters, racing sims, real-time strategy, and sports. These type of games require very fast and precise movements, which an ultra-high refresh rate and fast response time monitor will put you ahead of your competition.
TEAR FREE, STUTTER FREE, FLUID GAMING
Gaming shouldn't be a choice between choppy gameplay or broken frames. With MSI Optix series gaming monitors, it doesn't have to be. Get fluid, artifact-free performance at virtually any framerate with AMD FreeSync™ technology.
ANTI-FLICKER TECHNOLOGY
Generic monitor displays normally have a flicker-rate of about 200-times per second, which is unnoticeable to the naked eye, but can cause fatigue over time. MSI Anti-Flicker technology provides a very comfortable viewing experience by reducing the amount of flicker.
BLUE LIGHT REDUCTION
Optix monitors are optimized to produce less amount of blue light displayed by the monitor, so that you can game for longer periods of time without eye-fatigue.
178 DEGREES OF WIDE VIEWING ANGLE
By having a large viewing angle, Optix monitors has more leeway for placing your monitor in your setup without giving up the optimal viewing experience. Colors and details will stay sharp at more angles compared to other monitors with less viewing angles.

Open Frame 7"" USB Capacitive Touch Screen Monitor
The UM-760C-OF/UM-760CH-OF adds Capacitive touch to the 7"" line of open frame displays. The UM-760C-OF/UM-760CH-OF is a 7"" small capacitive open frame touchscreen monitor for applications that will be integrated into other equipment or enclosures. Same slick design features but now with the responsiveness of a 5 point multi-touch capacitive touchscreen all in a long-lasting molded metal product cycle-enclosure. Future generation panels can be phased-in without external changes. The screen can display in either landscape or portrait orientations. The UM-760C-OF/UM-760CH-OF open frame touchscreen monitor is designed to provide the most cost effective solutions for consumer, retail POS, and hospitality markets.
Available in Single Cable USB Video
Utilizing the same single cable USB display technology as our line of displays, the UM-760C-OF sends video, touch, and power over a single USB connection.
And now available with HDMI
Now optionally available with the ubiquitous HDMI input for video. Previously only available with the convenience of single cable USB video, the UM-760CH-OF from Mimo Monitors now offers HDMI to supplement where USB video is not supported or inconvenient. With the HID compliant touch screen plus HDMI video, the new UM-760CH-OF can be installed to almost any platform without drivers.
Uniquely, this new monitor line still reduces number of cables. While a typical HDMI touch display will require 3 separate cables, the new HDMI touch displays from Mimo Monitors only require 2 cables. This simplifies connection, and makes for a more attractive installation.

Through a combination of advanced algorithmic functions, the HDR Mode essentially transforms non-HDR content into HDR-like visuals via 3 different modes. By enhancing RGBCMY color for more vivid images (via improved saturation and range), increasing dynamic contrast for clarity and image sharpness, the HDR mode ensures you can experience HDR visuals when viewing standard quality content.
CURVED MONITOR
Delivering immersion and eye comfort
Curved screens offer a more immersive user experience that puts you at the center of the action. By mimicking the curvature of the eye, it is also less straining to track movement around the screen. The screen's deeper-than-average curvature provides a more engaging experience and allow you to enjoy beautiful visuals from almost any angle.
ULTRA NARROW BORDER
Slim, sleek, simple
Slim bezel and border monitors offer a comforting viewing experience without distraction. They also save space and can boost productivity via multi-monitor setups. This monitor comes with a 1.5mm ultra-narrow bezel and 5.8mm black screen border.
VA PANEL
Engineered for better visual experiences
The screen's VA panel delivers superior consistency in color temperature, wide viewing angles, and crisp contrast to ensure excellent image reproduction. Enjoy lifelike picture quality from every perspective.
LOW INPUT LAG
Connecting your eyes with your hands
Low input lag streamlines the user-to-monitor input process. This technology provides much faster motion delivery, so you'll always be up-to-speed with in-game action at just the right time.
FLICKER FREE
Protect your eyes from screen flicker
Flicker Free technology uses a smooth backlight system to prevent monitor flickering. This reduces eye strain and other damaging effects to your eyes - an especially valuable feature when working overtime, gaming for long hours or watching movies.
LOW BLUE MODE
Reducing shortwave blue light output for healthier eyes
Long exposure to short wavelength blue light may cause eye strain, sleep disorders, or headaches. AOC Low Blue Mode puts the user first by reducing the screen's short wavelength blue light emission without sacrificing color accuracy. Also provides four different filtering modes - reading, web browsing, multimedia, and office.

Open Frame 7"" USB Capacitive Touch Screen Monitor
The UM-760C-OF/UM-760CH-OF adds Capacitive touch to the 7"" line of open frame displays. The UM-760C-OF/UM-760CH-OF is a 7"" small capacitive open frame touchscreen monitor for applications that will be integrated into other equipment or enclosures. Same slick design features but now with the responsiveness of a 5 point multi-touch capacitive touchscreen all in a long-lasting molded metal product cycle-enclosure. Future generation panels can be phased-in without external changes. The screen can display in either landscape or portrait orientations. The UM-760C-OF/UM-760CH-OF open frame touchscreen monitor is designed to provide the most cost effective solutions for consumer, retail POS, and hospitality markets.
Available in Single Cable USB Video
Utilizing the same single cable USB display technology as our line of displays, the UM-760C-OF sends video, touch, and power over a single USB connection.
And now available with HDMI
Now optionally available with the ubiquitous HDMI input for video. Previously only available with the convenience of single cable USB video, the UM-760CH-OF from Mimo Monitors now offers HDMI to supplement where USB video is not supported or inconvenient. With the HID compliant touch screen plus HDMI video, the new UM-760CH-OF can be installed to almost any platform without drivers.
Uniquely, this new monitor line still reduces number of cables. While a typical HDMI touch display will require 3 separate cables, the new HDMI touch displays from Mimo Monitors only require 2 cables. This simplifies connection, and makes for a more attractive installation.

Leading in innovation
When you're at the forefront of ingenuity, you get noticed. It's no surprise the Dell UltraSharp 32 8K Monitor - UP3218K has received high praise and awards, including ""Best Monitor"" and ""Best Pixels"".
An unparalleled visual experience
Unprecedented realism: The world's first 31.5"" 8K monitor with Dell PremierColor is designed to impress with accurate colors and smooth gradation to create images so realistic, you don't see pixels.

Details shine: See the most detailed visuals ever on a 31.5"" monitor. With an outstanding 33.2 million pixel resolution and a high pixel density of 280ppi, you'll not miss a single detail.
See what you've been missing
When you compare this 8K monitor to other resolutions, there is no comparison. Four times more content than Ultra HD 4K. Sixteen times more content than Full HD.
Dell PremierColor: Exceptional for Color Professionals
A broad, brilliant spectrum: Dell PremierColor offers wide color coverage that meets major industry standards - 100% AdobeRGB, 100% sRGB, 100% Rec. 709, 98% DCI-P3 - for immaculate, unwavering colors.

Extraordinary color depth: Enjoy a tremendous level of detail that only the depth of 1.07 billion colors (that's 64 times more color depth than standard monitors) could provide. Even in dark areas, you'll see better color gradation and precision in more shades.

Fine-tune with precision: Customize color parameters to your preference using the Custom Color mode, the SDKi or the optional X-rite iDisplay Pro colorimeter.

Accurate color, out of the box: Your monitor is calibrated on AdobeRGB and sRGB to an accuracy of Delta-E less than 2. An included factory calibration report gives you the confidence that colors will be impressively accurate right from the start.
Beautiful and functional
Crafted to perfection: Modern aluminum and refined finishing create a modern and elegant design.

Virtually borderless: With Dell's InfinityEdge, you'll enjoy every detail of on-screen beauty without boundaries. An expansive, edge-to-edge viewing experience on one of the first virtually borderless 31.5"" monitors ensures that you'll be absorbed in the visuals, not distracted by the frame.

Easy on the eyes: This TUV Certified monitor has a flicker-free screen with ComfortView, a feature that filters out harmful blue light emissions to optimize eye comfort.
Superb usability
Customize for your needs: The height-adjustable stand lets you tilt, swivel and pivot to just the right viewing position for a comfortable setup and convenience while collaborating.

Multitasking made easy: Stay organized as you work on multiple applications, thanks to the Easy Arrange feature. Neatly tile the applications on one screen to view them all at once and quickly find exactly what you are looking for.

Made for the way you work: Compatible with multiple stands and mounts (including VESA), this monitor has flexible options to fit perfectly in your workspace.

Eizo,"FlexScan EV3285 31.5"" (80 cm) LCD Monitor",Displays,EV3285FX-BK,690592044928.0,1806.83,18.0,"EIZO FlexScan EV3285 31.5"" 4K UHD LED LCD Monitor - 16:9 - Black, White - 3840 x 2160 - 16.7 Million Colors - 350 Nit Typical - 5 ms GTG - HDMI - DisplayPort - Speaker EV3285FX-BK
Quadruple the Size of Your Work Space
Because various applications are used at work, a high resolution monitor with a large amount of work space is ideal for improving productivity. The EV3285 supports 4K resolution, displaying four times the amount of standard full HD monitors. With 4K you can display all applications on the one screen, without needing to switch windows or scroll through screens, allowing work to progress faster.
Fit 4K Resolution on Any Desk with this Fully Flat and Frameless Design
Conventional 4K monitors are large and bulky, making them difficult to install on small desks. The EV3285 solves this by adopting a fully flat and frameless design which keeps the monitor slim and lightweight. Compared to the previous model, the EV3285 has been reduced in volume by 17%, and the stand base has decreased by 12%. With these reductions, the EV3285 can comfortably fit on any desk.
Beautiful from Front to Back
One Cable ConnectionSingle Cable Connection with USB Type-C
When working on the go, a notebook PC is essential. But when work needs to be done in the office, connecting a notebook PC to an external monitor is beneficial. With USB Type-C, the EV3285 makes this new work style a breeze.
With a single USB Type-C cable you can transmit both video and audio signals, transfer data, and supply up to 60W of power to attached devices such as smartphones and notebooks. What's more, it has an internal power unit so no external AC adapter is required.
Without worrying about your notebook's battery level, you can simple plug it in and begin working immediately on a large external screen. Furthermore, a keyboard and mouse can be connected to the monitor and used instantly once the notebook is plugged in with USB Type-C.
60 W Power Supply for Use with High-End Notebooks
The USB Type-C terminal supplies up to 60 watts of power making it ideal for use with XPS, MacBook Pro, and other high-end notebooks.
Auto Brightness Control
To prevent eye fatigue, a brightness sensor called Auto EcoView detects the changes in the ambient brightness that occurs throughout the day and automatically adjusts the screen to the ideal brightness level.
Reduce Blue Light by 80%
In the visible light spectrum, blue light has wavelengths adjacent to ultraviolet light. Compared to the factory preset setting of 6500 K of typical LCD monitors, Paper Mode is closer to the spectral distribution with long reddish wavelengths so it reduces the amount of blue light, a cause of eye fatigue, and helps prevent eyestrain when reading documents. When used in conjunction with Auto EcoView dimming function, blue light can be reduced by as much as 80%.
Minimum Brightness of Approximately 1 cd/m2
In a dimly-lit work environment, a monitor with low brightness settings is more comfortable to use. With its LED backlight, the monitor is adjustable to approximately 1 cd/m² which is less than 1% of the maximum.
Versatile Stand
The stand features height adjustment, tilt, and swivel, while saving space and remaining stylish. Quickly and smoothly adjust your monitor to the perfect position.
Intelligent Software to Work Better
Auto Color Mode
Use the Auto Color Mode to assign a color mode to turn on when using specific applications such as those for writing documents, photo viewing, creating illustrations or watching movies. When an application is opened the screen will automatically switch to the assigned color mode, making manual switching unnecessary.

TUF gaming VG32VQ

NEXT-GEN ADAPTIVE-SYNC
TUF Gaming VG32V is a 32-inch, WQHD (2560x1440), curved HDR display with an ultrafast 144Hz refresh rate designed for professional gamers and those seeking immersive gameplay. Those are some serious specs, but not even the most exciting thing the VG32V has in store.
For the first time in any gaming monitor, Motion Blur Reduction and Adaptive-sync can be enabled at the same time. This new technology is called ASUS Extreme Low Motion Blur Sync (ELMB SYNC). ELMB SYNC works with FreeSync and other types of Adaptive-sync, allowing gamers to enjoy sharp, high speed frames.
31.5"" WQHD curve
The 31.5-inch WQHD (2560 X 1440) panel of TUF Gaming VG32VQ delivers stunning visuals from all angles with an 1800R curvature that ensures every point is equidistant to your eyes. This contributes to greater viewing comfort - even during extended use -and lets you enjoy a wide viewing angle with less distortion and color shift when gaming and watching movies.
144Hz Refresh Rate
TUF Gaming VG32VQ has a super-fast 144Hz refresh rate, ensuring that even fast-paced games played at the highest visual settings look buttery smooth and completely lag-free. Get the upper hand in first-person-shooters, racing, real-time strategy and sports titles.
EXTREME LOW MOTION BLUR SYNC
With ELMB SYNC, you can enable ELMB (low-motion-blur technology) and FreeSync at the same time, eliminating ghosting and tearing for sharp visuals and high frame rates while gaming.
Multi HDR Mode
Now you can choose from multiple HDR modes to adjust monitor HDR performance based on the current viewing scenario
Shadow Boost
ASUS Shadow Boost technology clarifies dark areas of the game without overexposing brighter areas, improving overall viewing while also making it easier to spot enemies hidden in dark areas of the map.
Rich connectivity
Extensive connectivity options, including, DisplayPort 1.2, and HDMI (v2.0) port support a wide array of multimedia devices.

All the essentials, and then some
Maximize your workspace: A thin profilei and improved cable management create a smaller footprint, lending itself to a clean, uncluttered desk.

Enhanced views: The Full HD resolution is ideal for everyday tasks, while ComfortView is ready for extended viewing periods. It reduces up to 60% of harmful blue light emissions.

Versatile connections: Our E Series monitors accommodate legacy and non-legacy systems with convenient connectivity options like VGA and DP ports. Your workspace will be completely customized to your needs.

Adapts to your needs: Make your workspace your own with VESA-compatible mounts and stands.
Improved Dell Display Manager
Productive at every level: Dell Display Manager's (DDM) Easy Arrange feature lets you quickly tile and view your applications side by side across one or more connected screens for multitasking efficiency. And with the improved DDM, you'll get even more preset layouts.

Seamless transitions: The auto-restore feature remembers where you left off, so applications will go back to where you left them, even after you've unplugged.

The key to convenience: Shortcut keys can save you even more time, letting you easily configure your display management settings so you can get to work faster.

More ways to manage: Asset management reports allow IT managers to quickly capture and track monitor information as well as configure multiple monitors at once through a single setup.
Eco-friendly inside and out
Guaranteed green: Compliant with the latest Energy Star® standards, the E Series monitors meet stringent energy efficiency requirements while in sleep, on and off modes. They're also EPEAT® registered and TCO-certified.

Energy reducing: Save energy with PowerNap, a feature that dims or puts the monitor to sleep when not in use.

Clean disposal: Composting or recycling the packaging is easy since it's made with at least 25% of recycled cardboard.

All the essentials, and then some
Maximize your workspace: A thin profilei and improved cable management create a smaller footprint, lending itself to a clean, uncluttered desk.

Enhanced views: The Full HD resolution is ideal for everyday tasks, while ComfortView is ready for extended viewing periods. It reduces up to 60% of harmful blue light emissions.

Versatile connections: Our E Series monitors accommodate legacy and non-legacy systems with convenient connectivity options like VGA and DP ports. Your workspace will be completely customized to your needs.

Adapts to your needs: Make your workspace your own with VESA-compatible mounts and stands.
Improved Dell Display Manager
Productive at every level: Dell Display Manager's (DDM) Easy Arrange feature lets you quickly tile and view your applications side by side across one or more connected screens for multitasking efficiency. And with the improved DDM, you'll get even more preset layouts.

Seamless transitions: The auto-restore feature remembers where you left off, so applications will go back to where you left them, even after you've unplugged.

The key to convenience: Shortcut keys can save you even more time, letting you easily configure your display management settings so you can get to work faster.

More ways to manage: Asset management reports allow IT managers to quickly capture and track monitor information as well as configure multiple monitors at once through a single setup.
Eco-friendly inside and out
Guaranteed green: Compliant with the latest Energy Star® standards, the E Series monitors meet stringent energy efficiency requirements while in sleep, on and off modes. They're also EPEAT® registered and TCO-certified.

Energy reducing: Save energy with PowerNap, a feature that dims or puts the monitor to sleep when not in use.

Clean disposal: Composting or recycling the packaging is easy since it's made with at least 25% of recycled cardboard.

ASUS VP28UQG 28"" 4K/UHD 3840x2160 1ms DP HDMI Adaptive Sync/FreeSync™ Eye Care Monitor
The ASUS VP28UQG gaming display is built for victory in the professional gaming arena. With its 4K UHD panel and 1ms response time, it blurs the line between what's virtual and what's real to draw you into truly immersive gaming worlds. It even includes gamer-centric features like ASUS GamePlus technologies to take your gaming experience to a whole new level.
A 28-inch 4K UHD display for highly-detailed visuals and more onscreen space
With its 28-inch 4K UHD display, ASUS VP28UQG gives you stunning 3840 x 2160 resolution visuals with a pixel density of 157PPI for incredible photo-realistic visuals and sharp, crisp text. The VP28UQG gives you four times the pixels of similar-sized Full HD 1080p displays so you get more detailed images when playing games or watching movies, as well as more onscreen desktop space for your various work windows. VP28UQG draws you into immersive virtual worlds, with greatly-textured elements and terrain maps that boast impressive levels of detail.
Conventional 28-inch 1920 x 1080 monitor
Shows less detail and spacing with less room for work bars on the side.
Images are relatively blurrier.
VP28UQG 28-inch 3840 x 2160 monitor
See more details and 3 times more onscreen space for working bar on the side. Images are much more crisp and detailed.
Lightning-fast 1ms rapid response time
Even with today's fastest games, ASUS VP28UQG eliminates smearing and motion blur thanks to a 1ms response time - the fastest in its class. This astonishing visual performance lets you react instinctively to what you see onscreen, so you can take corners like a pro race car driver, or take an enemy out with a headshot as he peeks around cover. In addition, Adaptive-Sync/FreeSync™ eliminates screen tearing and choppy frame rates for even more seamlessly smooth gameplay.
Robust connectivity
Whether you're playing games or streaming videos, ASUS VP28UQG gives you smooth 4K UHD content playback, thanks to a 60Hz refresh rate and native 4K UHD support via DisplayPort 1.2, HDMI(v 2.0).
Gamer-centric features
ASUS-exclusive GamePlus technology
ASUS VP28UQG features the ASUS-exclusive GamePlus to give you in-game enhancements that help you get more out of your game. These tools allow gamers to practice and improve on their gaming skills.
Crosshair
You can choose between four persistent crosshairs and fine tune their position, ensuring pinpoint accuracy in first-person shooters. Enjoy perfect aim even when the game doesn't provide its own crosshair or sights.
Get ready for marathon gaming sessions
Ultra-Low Blue Light technology
ASUS Ultra-Low Blue Light technology reduces the amount of harmful blue light emitted by ASUS VP28UQG. You can access and select four different filter settings onscreen easily through the OSD menu to find the best one that suits the task at hand.
